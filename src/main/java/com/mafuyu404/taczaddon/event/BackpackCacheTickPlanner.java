 *
 * <pre>
 * world join / player or level change
 *     exactly one BOOTSTRAP_REQUEST (never a rebuild on the same tick)
 *     cache refresh is deferred BACKPACK_CACHE_REFRESH_TICKS
 *
 * later ticks
 *     PERIODIC_SYNC_REQUEST only while holding a gun and every
 *         BACKPACK_SYNC_INTERVAL_TICKS (recovery, not correctness)
 *     REBUILD_CACHE when the refresh deadline passed or a payload
 *         invalidation reset it to 0
 * </pre>
