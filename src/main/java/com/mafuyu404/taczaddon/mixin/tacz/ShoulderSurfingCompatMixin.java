/**
 * Bypasses TaCZ 1.1.8's obsolete SSR 4.x crosshair path only when a
 * structurally verified SSR 5.x API generation is installed.
 *
 * <p>The TaCZ binary contract only proves that the target method exists. It
 * proves nothing about Shoulder Surfing's own API generation, so the two
 * capabilities stay separate: the injection point is validated against TaCZ,
 * while the runtime decision is delegated to the optional-safe SSR facade.
 *
 * <p>Dispatch (see {@link ShoulderSurfingDispatch}):
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>absent or legacy - do not cancel, TaCZ's own native path runs;</li>
 *     <li>verified 5.x - answer from the addon backend;</li>
 *     <li>unknown generation, or a verified 5.x backend that broke - answer
 *     {@code false} and never enter TaCZ's legacy backend, whose classes would
 *     fail to link.</li>
